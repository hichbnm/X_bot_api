🔍 Summary of the Task
You are to build a Node.js + Puppeteer-based backend service that will:

Receive API requests to post content to X (formerly Twitter)

Use Puppeteer to automate browser actions to post on X via:

New post on timeline

Reply to an existing post (via URL)

Operate through a proxy server

Handle errors gracefully and maintain sessions

Be deployed inside Docker

Provide a REST API interface secured with a bearer token

Include logging and debugging mechanisms (screenshots and logs on failure)

Support future X platform changes for 2 months

🎯 Core Functionalities
Feature	Description
API Authentication	Only process requests with a valid bearer token
Proxy Support	All Puppeteer sessions must route through a specified proxy
Session Management	Reuse or re-login when session is invalid
Posting Capability	Post tweets or replies via the browser UI
Error Handling	Log screenshots and avoid blocking future requests if one fails
Dockerized	Deploy as a containerized service
Documentation	Provide endpoint specs for integration

🚀 Technical Complexity
Component	Complexity	Notes
Puppeteer Automation	⚠️ Medium-High	X has anti-bot measures (Cloudflare, rate limits, JS challenges). Stealth plugins & careful human-like behavior needed.
Proxy Routing	✅ Low	Puppeteer supports proxies easily (--proxy-server=...)
Session Handling	⚠️ Medium	You’ll need to manage login persistence or re-login automatically
API Server	✅ Medium	Standard Express server with bearer auth
Error Recovery	✅ Medium	Try-catch with screenshot saving and logging on failure
Docker Setup	✅ Easy	Standard Dockerfile, possibly using Chromium in headless mode

🛠️ Tech Stack
Node.js

Puppeteer (+ puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth)

Express.js (for API)

Winston or Pino for logging

Docker

Optionally: Redis or File Storage (for session persistence)

🧭 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Setup API Service

Use Express.js with bearer token middleware

Define routes: /post, /reply

Add rate limiter and request validation

Configure Puppeteer with Proxy and Stealth Mode

Use puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

Launch Chromium with --proxy-server=...

Set realistic user-agent and viewport

Build Login Flow

Script login via username/password (or cookies if provided)

Save session (cookies/localStorage) to disk or memory

Auto-retry login if 403/401 or session expires

Implement Posting Logic

For new posts: open X homepage > click "post" > type > submit

For replies: open post URL > find reply box > type > submit

Error Handling

Wrap Puppeteer actions in try/catch

On failure: log error, capture screenshot, return error without crashing

Continue to next request if queue-based

Dockerize

Use a Dockerfile to bundle the app

Base image should support Chromium (like node:18-slim + puppeteer install)

Add CMD ["node", "index.js"]

Document the API

Define endpoints, request structure, and responses

Example:

POST /post: { "content": "Hello world" }

POST /reply: { "url": "...", "content": "Nice post!" }

Testing and Logging

Log every request and response (success/failure)

Store screenshots on failure

Provide a debug log (with timestamp and error stack)
